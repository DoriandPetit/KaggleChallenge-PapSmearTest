# KaggleChallenge-PapSmearTest
The evaluation of IMA205 course, a private Kaggle competition that was a binary and a multi-class classifications on cancerous cells.

This was made not long after I discovered deep learning, and the final scores were a bit disappointing as I explain in the report.
Note that the optimal solution (in order to obtain the best results) was in fact, quite simple : it required using transfer learning, from a pre-trained model available on tensorflow (VGG for instance), to our own problem with a small re-training.
